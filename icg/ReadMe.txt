A simple "card game" i made one afternoon to help me memorize integrals for calc 2.
The 20 integrals we needed to memorize are cards(pictures)You must drag the correct answer to the question into the Zone.
The integral answer cards are seperated by "Comma Turtles" and must be dragged to the answer area next to the "Equal Gator".

The game uses HTML, JS, & JQuery.
